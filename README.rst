Warning, this is a BETA role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This role has been marked by the author as a beta role, which means that it
might be significantly changed in the future. Be careful while using this role
in a production environment.

****

Ansible role ``debops.encfs`` allows you to create and manage directories
using `EncFS`_, FUSE-based encrypted virtual filesystem.

.. _EncFS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EncFS

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This role requires at least Ansible ``v1.4``. To install it, run:

::

    ansible-galaxy install debops.encfs

Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?
=======================================================

You may need to include missing roles from the `DebOps common playbook`_
into your playbook.

`Try DebOps now`_ for a complete solution to run your Debian-based infrastructure.

Role variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of default variables available in the inventory:

::

    ---
    
    # Absolute path to a directory where encrypted filesystem will be mounted
    # Required
    encfs: False
    
    # Suffix of the directory with encrypted filesystem, it will be created in the
    # same path as the mount directory
    encfs_suffix: ".encrypted"
    
    # List of GPG keys to use to encrypt encfs keyfile. GPG encryption is supported
    # only on localhost (hosts which have ansible_connection=local set). Without
    # list of GPG recipients, GnuPG will ask for a passphrase instead
    encfs_gpg: []
    
    # Password to use instead of GPG keys / GPG passphrase. Supports encfs on
    # remote hosts. Will be sent via stdout and visible in 'ps' and Ansible logs,
    # use an external file with encfs_passfile to mitigate that.
    # You can populate this variable from an external file using lookup('file','path')
    encfs_password: False
    
    # An absolute path to file on remote host to store the password in transit.
    # Will be shredded when no longer needed. encfs role creates two files with this
    # name + suffixes '_init' and '_pass'
    encfs_passfile: False
    
    # By default encfs role behaves as a toggle - opens the encrypted filesystem if
    # it's closed, closes it if opened. By setting encfs_mode (for example with
    # --extra-vars) you can force desired mode of operation:
    #  - 'open' - create or open encrypted filesystem
    #  - 'close' - close encrypted filesystem
    encfs_mode: False
    
    # Device to use as source of randomness. You can change that to '/dev/urandom'
    # to use faster but weaker randomness source
    encfs_random: '/dev/random'
